                    <h5>Foundation</h5>
                    <p> 
                        In the year 1922 the late Mr Elijah Wathika and late Reuben Ngure welcomed the late Dr. Arthurand Samuel Gitau Kangugi
                        to Kahunira(kwa ngoma-hwai) where they bult a grass thatched mud walled church. The church was also used as a classroom.
                        The first believers were:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Reuben Ngure Gichuru</li>
                            <li>Elijah Wathika</li>
                            <li>Abednego Kagunya (who was a teacher then)</li>
                        </ol>
                        Elijah Wathika and Simon Kiongo attended catechism classes and on completion were baptized together with James Kaberere
                        and Stephen Kamiri from Githiga by the late Rev. Benjamin Githieya in 1926.

                    <h5>Resistance</h5>
                    <p> 
                        On 13th September 1929 the church prohibited female circumcision. This issue split the church into two camps , those who wanted
                        to adhere to church and the other group wanted the practice to continue. A song Muthirigu was composed to redicule the believers.
                        This led to the closure of Kahunira church and the faithful started going to worship at Kagaa.

                    <h5>Rebirth</h5>
                    <p> 
                        In 1942 Elder Abednego Kagunya Njuguna was sent from Thogoto as an evengelist and was able to attract many followers.
                        In 1946 a tin roffed mud walled church was built, on the same year Kahunira primary school was started (Mr Njuru was the first teacher).
                        In 1952 the church offered refuge after a state of emergency was declared.
                        In 1958 after the government started land demarcation, the land was extended to Kiruchi river.

                    <h5>Construction</h5>
                    <p> 
                        After the church got its land an idea to build a stoned walled church came up.
                        In 1963 by the First African Moderator of general assembly Rev Charles Muhoro Kareri, laid the foundation stone of the 
                        church.
                        It was completed on 16th August 1964 and dedicated by Rev Crispus Kiongo.
                        In 1976 the church leadership decided to expand the existing church by electing wings to serve as vestry.
                        On December 16th 1984 Githunguri parish was split into two parish, Githunguri and Githiga.
                        In 1986, the idea to build a new church was proposed to accomodate the increasing members.
                        The foundation stone was laid by Rev Ibrahim Kamau in 1988. PCEA Kahunira was changed to PCEA Elijah Wathika Memorial Church.
                        On Sunday 27th December 1998 the church was dedicated by Rev Jesse Macharia.

                    <p> 
                        On 6th December 1998 the idea to buy a land and construct a church at Gitwe was implemented.
                        In 2012 September the current Kahunira parish was inagurated together with Githunguri and Gathanji parish.
                        In 2015 the kirk sesion decided to plant a new church at ngeteti. The family of Elder Isaac Mburu Wathika agreed to
                        donate the land.
